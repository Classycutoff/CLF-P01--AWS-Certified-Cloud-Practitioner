An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines how software components or systems should interact, making it possible for developers to create applications that can leverage the functionality of other services, libraries, or platforms without needing to understand their internal workings.
