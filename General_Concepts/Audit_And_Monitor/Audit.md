**Auditing:** Auditing involves the systematic examination and evaluation of an organization's IT systems, processes, and controls to determine their adherence to security policies, compliance regulations, and industry standards. The primary goal of auditing is to assess whether security measures are effectively implemented and to identify vulnerabilities or areas of non-compliance. Auditing is often performed by internal or external auditors, and it can involve various types of audits:

- **Compliance Audits:** Assess whether an organization adheres to industry-specific regulations and standards (e.g., [[HIPAA]], [[PCI DSS]], [[SOC]]). ([[Compliance Services]],  [[Compliance Controls]])
- **Security Audits:** Evaluate the effectiveness of security controls and measures to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Operational Audits:** Examine operational processes to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Configuration Audits:** Review system configurations to identify misconfigurations that could lead to vulnerabilities.

Auditing involves reviewing logs, examining security policies, performing vulnerability assessments, and conducting interviews with personnel. The results of audits are used to generate reports that highlight findings, risks, recommendations, and potential corrective actions.
