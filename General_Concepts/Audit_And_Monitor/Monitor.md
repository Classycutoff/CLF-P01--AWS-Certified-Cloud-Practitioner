# Monitor
---------------
**Monitoring:** Monitoring refers to the continuous observation of an IT environment's activities, events, and changes in real-time. The goal of monitoring is to detect anomalies, security incidents, and operational issues as they occur or shortly after. Monitoring helps organizations respond quickly to threats and ensure the availability and performance of systems. Different types of monitoring include:

- **Security Monitoring:** Detects unauthorized access, suspicious activities, and potential breaches. It involves analyzing logs, network traffic, and behavior patterns.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks system performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory utilization, and network traffic to ensure optimal operation.
- **Log Monitoring:** Reviews logs generated by various systems to identify unusual patterns or events that might indicate security threats or operational problems.
- **Event Monitoring:** Watches for specific events or triggers, such as failed login attempts or unusual user behavior.
- **Incident Monitoring:** Monitors for incidents that could potentially impact operations or security and triggers alerts for response.
