# Horizontal scaling

A "horizontally scalable" system is one that can increase capacity by adding more computers to the system. This is in contrast to a "vertically scalable" system, which is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems the only way to increase [performance](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.pillar.performance.en.html "The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.") is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, [memory](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.memory.en.html "A component of a computer system that is designed for short-term, fast-access, data storage; often this is Random-Access Memory (RAM), but there are other forms as well.") or storage.

Horizontally scalable systems are oftentimes able to outperform vertically scalable systems by enabling parallel execution of [workloads](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.workload.en.html "The set of components that together deliver business value.") and distributing those across many different computers.
