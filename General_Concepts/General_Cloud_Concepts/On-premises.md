"On-premises," often referred to as "on-prem" or "on-premises deployment," is a term used to describe the practice of hosting and managing computer systems, software, and infrastructure within an organization's own physical location or data center, rather than relying on external cloud services or third-party hosting facilities. In other words, on-premises refers to having IT resources and applications located and operated within an organization's premises, such as its own office building or data center facility.
