# Data warehouse

A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make better informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems,Â [relational databases](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.relational.en.html "A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them."), and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.
