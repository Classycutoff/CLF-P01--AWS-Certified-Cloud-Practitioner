An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network. It serves as the device's identifier and allows it to communicate with other devices on the internet or within a local network. IP addresses come in two main formats: [[IPv4]] (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and [[IPv6]] (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334). They play a crucial role in routing data packets across networks, enabling seamless internet communication.
