## What is this?
This is all my notes on Cloud Practitioner Exam. It has a lot of services, concepts, resources, and actually guides for the exam. Start with [[Certified Cloud Practitioner]], because it is exhaustive guide for the exam. But don't rely on only these notes. Best thing to do is practise exams. So read these, try your knowledge on practise exams, until you have ~90 % at least.
