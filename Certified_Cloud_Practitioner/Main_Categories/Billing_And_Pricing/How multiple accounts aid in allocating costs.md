# How multiple accounts aid in allocating costs
--------------
Using multiple AWS accounts can be an effective strategy for allocating costs across different departments within an organization. Here's how multiple accounts aid in cost allocation:


1. **Consolidated Billing**: AWS offers the option of consolidated billing for multiple accounts. This means that you can have a master billing account that is linked to individual department accounts. The master account receives a single bill that combines the costs from all linked accounts. This simplifies the billing process and allows you to see the overall spending across all departments.

2. **Isolation of Resources**: Each AWS account acts as a separate and isolated environment. By creating separate accounts for different departments, you can ensure that resources and services used by each department are kept separate. This isolation makes it easier to attribute costs accurately to each department.
    
3. **Resource Tagging**: Within each AWS account, resources can be tagged with metadata that reflects the department responsible for those resources. Tags are key-value pairs that can be attached to resources, and they can provide valuable information for cost allocation purposes.

4. **Cost and Usage Reports**: AWS provides detailed cost and usage reports that break down expenses by resource, service, and time period. These reports can be filtered and grouped based on tags, enabling you to generate cost breakdowns for each department.
    
5. **Resource Groups**: AWS offers resource grouping features that allow you to group resources based on certain criteria, including tags. You can create resource groups that represent each department's resources and then view cost and usage data specifically for those groups.
    
6. **Budgets and Alerts**: With multiple accounts, you can set up budget thresholds and spending alerts for each department. This helps departments stay within their allocated budgets and prevents overspending.
    
7. **Custom Reports**: Using AWS Cost Explorer, you can create custom cost allocation reports based on tags and other criteria. This allows you to generate reports tailored to your organization's specific cost allocation needs.
    
8. **Granular Reporting**: Multiple accounts enable you to generate reports at the account level, providing a clear breakdown of costs for each department. This granularity allows for accurate and transparent cost allocation.
