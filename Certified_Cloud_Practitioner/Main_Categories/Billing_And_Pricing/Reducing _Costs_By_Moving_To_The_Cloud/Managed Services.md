Cloud providers offer a range of managed services like [[Amazon RDS]] (Relational Database Service), [[Amazon ECS]] (Elastic Container Service), [[Amazon EKS]] (Elastic Kubernetes Service), and [[Amazon DynamoDB]]. These services offload operational tasks such as database management, container orchestration, and [[NoSQL]] database administration. By using managed services, organizations can save on the costs and expertise required to operate and maintain these services in-house
