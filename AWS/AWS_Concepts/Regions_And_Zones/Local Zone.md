A Local Zone is an extension of an AWS [[Region]] in geographic proximity to your users. Local Zones have their own connections to the internet and support AWS [[AWS Direct Connect]], so that resources created in a Local Zone can serve local users with low-latency communications. For more information, see [AWS Local Zones](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/).

The code for a Local Zone is its Region code followed by an identifier that indicates its physical location. For example, `us-west-2-lax-1` in Los Angeles.
