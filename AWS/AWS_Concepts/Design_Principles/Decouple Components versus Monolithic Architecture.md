In traditional [[monolithic]] architectures, all components of an application are tightly interconnected. However, in the cloud, it's often more advantageous to design systems with [[loosely coupled architecture]] components. This approach, known as microservices architecture, involves breaking down the application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Decoupling components simplifies maintenance, enhances [[scalability]], and allows for more flexible development and deployment processes.
