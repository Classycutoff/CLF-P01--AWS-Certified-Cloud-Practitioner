Cloud environments are well-suited for parallel processing due to the availability of distributed computing resources. Designing systems with parallelism in mind allows workloads to be divided into smaller tasks that can be processed simultaneously. This can lead to improved performance and reduced processing times. Parallelism can be achieved through techniques like distributed databases, parallel data processing frameworks, and multi-threaded processing.
