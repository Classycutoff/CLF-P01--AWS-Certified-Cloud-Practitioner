This principle acknowledges that failures are inevitable and focuses on designing systems to be resilient in the face of failures. Instead of trying to prevent failures entirely, cloud architects should assume that components will fail and plan for such scenarios. This involves implementing redundancy, distributing workloads across multiple [[availability zone]]s, and using services that automatically recover from failures. By designing for failure, systems can continue to operate smoothly even when individual components experience issues.
