[[Elasticity]] refers to the ability of a system to automatically scale resources up or down based on demand. In the cloud, elasticity is easier to achieve compared to [[On-premises]] environments due to the availability of scalable resources on demand. Cloud platforms allow organizations to adjust their resources in response to fluctuating workloads. This ensures that systems can handle peak demands without over-provisioning resources during low-demand periods, leading to cost savings.
