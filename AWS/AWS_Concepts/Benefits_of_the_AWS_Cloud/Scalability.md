Scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability to easily adjust computing resources, such as processing power or storage, to accommodate changing demands. Cloud services provide scalable solutions that can quickly scale up to handle increased workloads or scale down during periods of lower activity, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

- **[[Vertical Scaling]] and [[Horizontal Scaling]]:** Cloud platforms support both vertical (increasing resource capacity of a single instance) and horizontal (adding more instances) scaling, ensuring your application can grow as needed.
- **Resource Management:** Cloud services provide tools to manage your scaling policies automatically, adapting to changing workloads without manual intervention.
