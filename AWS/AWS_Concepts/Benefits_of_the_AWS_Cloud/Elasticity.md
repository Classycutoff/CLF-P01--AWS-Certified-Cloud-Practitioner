With elasticity, the company doesn't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity they'll need - elasticity allows them to match the supply of resources with changing workload demands.

Most people, when thinking of cloud computing, think of the ease with which they can procure resources when needed. This is only one aspect to elasticity. The other aspect is to contract when they no longer need resources. Scale out and scale in. Scale up and scale down. Some services do this as part of their service: [Amazon S3](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.amazonsimplestorageservice.en.html "Storage for the internet. You can use it to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web."), [Amazon SQS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.amazonsimplequeueservice.en.html "Reliable and scalable hosted queues for storing messages as they travel between computers."), [Amazon SNS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.sns.en.html "A web service that enables applications, end-users, and devices to instantly send and receive notifications from the cloud."), [Amazon SES](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.ses.en.html "An easy-to-use, cost-effective email solution for applications."), [Amazon Aurora](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.aurora.en.html "A fully managed MySQL-compatible relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases."), etc. Some require vertical scaling, like [Amazon RDS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.amazonrelationaldatabaseservice.en.html "A web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient, resizable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks."). Others integrate with [AWS Auto Scaling](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.awsautoscaling.en.html "A fully managed service that enables you to quickly discover the scalable AWS resources that are part of your application and configure dynamic scaling."), like [Amazon EC2](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.ec2.en.html "A web service that enables you to launch and manage Linux/UNIX and Windows server instances in Amazon's data centers."), [Amazon ECS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.ecs.en.html "A highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster of EC2 instances."), AWS Fargate, Amazon EKS, and [Amazon DynamoDB](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.dynamodb.en.html "A fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability."). [Amazon Aurora](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/2020-07-02T19-33-23/wat.concept.aurora.en.html "A fully managed MySQL-compatible relational database engine that combines the speed and availability of commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases.") Serverless and Amazon Athena also qualify as elastic.

### Important Concepts
- **[[Auto Scaling]]:** Cloud platforms enable you to automatically adjust the number of resources allocated to your application based on demand. This elasticity ensures that you can handle varying workloads without manual intervention.
- **Resource Optimization:** Resources can be scaled down during periods of low demand, optimizing costs while maintaining performance.
