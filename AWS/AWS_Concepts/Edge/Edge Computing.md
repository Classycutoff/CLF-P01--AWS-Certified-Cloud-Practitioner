## What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing is the process of bringing information storage and computing abilities closer to the devices that produce that information and the users who consume it. Traditionally, applications have transmitted data from smart devices like sensors and smartphones to a central data center for processing. However, the unprecedented complexity and scale of data have outpaced network capabilities. By shifting processing capabilities closer to users and devices, edge computing systems significantly improve application performance, reduce bandwidth requirements, and give faster real-time insights.
