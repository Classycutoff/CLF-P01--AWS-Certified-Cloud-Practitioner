- An **identity** could be an IAM user, an IAM role, or an external user authenticated through a third-party identity provider.
    
- The **principal** represents this identity when interacting with AWS resources. For example, if an IAM user tries to access an S3 bucket, that IAM user is the principal.
    
- The **resource** is the AWS entity the principal is trying to access. In this case, the S3 bucket is the resource.
	
- An **entity** generally refers to an identity or resource that can be authenticated and authorized to interact with AWS services and resources.
