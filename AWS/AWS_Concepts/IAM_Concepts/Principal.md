A principal is an entity that is allowed to interact with AWS resources. Principals can represent [[IAM users]], [[IAM roles]], AWS services, or even external identities (such as users authenticated through an identity provider like [[AWS Cognito]] or SAML). Principals are the "actors" that perform actions on AWS resources. They can request access and perform actions based on the permissions they have been granted.


A principal is a person or application that uses the AWS account root user, an IAM user, or an IAM role to sign in and make requests to AWS.
