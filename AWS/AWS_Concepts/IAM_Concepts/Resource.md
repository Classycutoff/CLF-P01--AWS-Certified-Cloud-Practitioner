A resource is an AWS entity that a principal can access and interact with. Resources can include things like [[Amazon S3]] buckets, [[Amazon EC2]] instances, [[Amazon RDS]] databases, [[AWS Lambda]] functions, and more. Each resource in AWS has an [[Amazon Resource Name]] (ARN), a unique identifier that specifies the resource's location and attributes. Access to resources is controlled through permissions.
