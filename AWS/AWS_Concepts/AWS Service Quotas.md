Your AWS account has default quotas, formerly referred to as limits, for each AWS service. Unless otherwise noted, each quota is [[Region]]-specific. You can request increases for some quotas, and other quotas cannot be increased.

Service Quotas is an AWS service that helps you manage your quotas for many AWS services, from one location. Along with looking up the quota values, you can also request a quota increase from the Service Quotas console.

[[AWS Support]] might approve, deny, or partially approve your requests.
