The security pillar encompasses the ability to protect data, systems, and assets to take advantage of cloud technologies to improve your security.

### Design Principles

There are seven design principles for security in the cloud:

- Implement a strong identity foundation
- Enable traceability
- Apply security at all layers
- Automate security best practices
- Protect data [[In Transit]] and [[At Rest]]
- Keep people away from data
- Prepare for security events

### Best Practices

Before you architect any workload, you need to put in place practices that influence security. You’ll want to control who can do what. In addition, you want to be able to identify security incidents, protect your systems and services, and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of data through data protection.

You should have a well-defined and practiced process for responding to security incidents. These tools and techniques are important because they support objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with regulatory obligations.

The AWS [[Shared Responsibility Model]]: [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) enables organizations that adopt the cloud to achieve their security and compliance goals. Because AWS physically secures the infrastructure that supports our cloud services, as an AWS customer you can focus on using services to accomplish your goals. The AWS Cloud also provides greater access to security data and an automated approach to responding to security events.

### Important Concepts

- **Identity and Access Management ([[AWS IAM]]):** Cloud providers like AWS offer robust IAM systems that allow you to control who has access to your resources, granting permissions based on roles and responsibilities.
- **Encryption:** Cloud platforms offer encryption at rest and in transit, ensuring that your data remains secure both while stored and during transmission.
- **Security Compliance:** Cloud providers adhere to various industry standards and compliance regulations, helping you maintain a secure environment while meeting necessary requirements. ([[Security, Identity and Compliance Services]])
- **Firewalls and Network Security:** Cloud services include features like virtual firewalls and network security groups to control traffic and protect your applications from unauthorized access. ([[AWS WAF]])
