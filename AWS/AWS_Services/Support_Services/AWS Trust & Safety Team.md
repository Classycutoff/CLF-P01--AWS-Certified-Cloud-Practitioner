## DESCRIPTION

AWS Trust & Safety (T&S) is a global team that helps protect against abusive use of AWS services while simultaneously working to build trust with AWS’s customers, partners, and other stakeholders. T&S engages with a variety of stakeholders to understand cloud infrastructure-related trust and safety issues, develop fit-for-purpose frameworks to assess and minimize risks for AWS’s customers, and develop guidelines and processes for responding to trust and safety issues. Our team members display a solid understanding of AWS’s cloud infrastructure, strong technical knowledge, and the ability to exercise sound judgment on complex and time-sensitive matters.
