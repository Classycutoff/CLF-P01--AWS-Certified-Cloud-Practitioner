AWS Abuse addresses many different types of potentially abusive activity such as phishing, malware, spam, and denial of service (DoS)/ distributed denial of service ([[DDoS]]) incidents. When abuse is reported, we alert customers so they can take the remediation action that is necessary. Customers want to build automation for handling abuse events and the actions to remediate them.
