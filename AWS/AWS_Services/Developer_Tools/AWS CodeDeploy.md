## How it works

AWS CodeDeploy is a fully managed deployment service that automates software deployments to various compute services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud ([[Amazon EC2]]), Amazon Elastic Container Service ([[Amazon ECS]]), AWS [[AWS Lambda]], and your on-premises servers. Use CodeDeploy to automate software deployments, eliminating the need for error-prone manual operations.
