Fully managed Pub/Sub service for A2A and A2P messaging.

-------

## How it works

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) sends notifications two ways, A2A and A2P. A2A provides high-throughput, push-based, many-to-many messaging between distributed systems, microservices, and event-driven serverless applications. These applications include Amazon Simple Queue Service ([[AWS SQS]]), Amazon [[Kinesis Data Firehose]], AWS [[AWS Lambda]], and other HTTPS endpoints. A2P functionality lets you send messages to your customers with SMS texts, push notifications, and email.
