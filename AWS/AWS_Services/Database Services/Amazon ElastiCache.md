# AWS ElastiCache

Real-time performance for real-time applications.

You can use ElastiCache to store the results of often-used queries, and this will allow quicker retrieval of this data.

## What Is Amazon ElastiCache?

[Amazon ElastiCache](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache/) is a cache-as-a-service developed and distributed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It comes as a fully managed solution that has the ability to deploy, manage, and scale a distributed in-memory cache environment [in the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/history-of-the-cloud). 

Amazon describes it as a service that allows you to easily create, operate, and scale open-source compatible in-memory data stores [within the cloud](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/what-is-the-cloud). Simply, this means that it eliminates the complexity associated with setting up and managing a distributed cache environment. 

The system itself is built to boost the performance of web-based applications by reducing the database load through the quick retrieval of data from high throughput and low latency in-memory data stores. As such, you can think of it as a high-performance caching system that facilitates demanding web applications requiring a quick response. 

That said, it’s worth noting that Amazon ElastiCache relies on two different caching engines — [[Memcache]]d and [[Redis]].

## How it works

Amazon ElastiCache is a fully managed, Redis- and Memcached-compatible service delivering real-time, cost-optimized performance for modern applications. ElastiCache scales to hundreds of millions of operations per second with microsecond response time, and offers enterprise-grade security and reliability.
