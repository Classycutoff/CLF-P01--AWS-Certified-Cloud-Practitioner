Amazon Detective is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps customers analyze and visualize data from their AWS resources to identify and investigate security issues and anomalies. It automatically collects and analyzes log data, presenting a clear picture of potential security threats and making it easier for security teams to detect and respond to suspicious activities within their AWS environments.
