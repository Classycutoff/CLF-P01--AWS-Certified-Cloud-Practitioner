## How it works

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) lets you create, manage, and control cryptographic keys across your applications and AWS services.

Centrally manage keys and define policies across integrated services and applications from a single point.
Encrypt data within your applications with the AWS Encryption SDK dataÂ encryption library.
Perform signing operations using asymmetric key pairs to validate digital signatures.
Securely generate hash-based message authentication codes (HMACs) that ensure message integrity and authenticity.
