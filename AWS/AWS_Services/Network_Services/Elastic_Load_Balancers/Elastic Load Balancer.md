# Load Balancing (Elastic Load Balancing)

Distribute network traffic to improve application scalability

---------

## How it works

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, like EC2 Instances and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs).

Elastic load balancers are used to balance traffic between [[Amazon EC2]] instances, typically in an [[EC2 Auto Scaling]] group.

Elastic Load Balancing supports the following load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers.
