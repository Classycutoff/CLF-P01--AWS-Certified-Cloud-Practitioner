Route 53 is a [[DNS]] service that routes users to applications. Amazon Route 53 effectively connects user requests to infrastructure running in AWS (e.g., Amazon [[Amazon EC2]] instances, [[Elastic Load Balancer]]s, or Amazon [[AWS S3]] buckets) and can also be used to route users to infrastructure outside of AWS.
