# AWS VPN

AWS VPN (Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Network) is a service that allows you to establish secure and encrypted communication between your on-premises network or data center and your Amazon Web Services (AWS) virtual private cloud ([[VPC]]) or other AWS resources. It provides a way to connect your local network infrastructure to your AWS environment over the internet, creating a secure and private connection that enables you to extend your on-premises network into the AWS cloud.

Key features and concepts of AWS VPN include:

1. **VPN Connection Types:**
    
    - **Site-to-Site VPN:** This type of connection allows you to establish a secure and encrypted communication channel between your on-premises network and your AWS VPC. It enables data to flow securely between your local network and your AWS resources.
    - **Client VPN:** Client VPN provides secure remote access for individual users or devices to connect to your AWS resources. It's useful for remote workers or users who need access to resources within your VPC.
