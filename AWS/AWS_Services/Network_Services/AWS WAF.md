# AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)

Protect your web applications from common exploits.

------------
## How it works

AWS WAF helps you protect against common web exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources.

There is a rule type in WAF called a "rate-based" rule that protects you from web-layer DDoS attacks, brute-force login attempts, and bots. (Note: This requires very detailed knowledge of WAF and will probably not be on the exam, but it's good to know just in case.)
