Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides several options for connecting your on-premises network to your AWS resources securely. These connectivity options allow you to establish a reliable and private connection for data transfer, access to services, and more. Here are some of the key connectivity options for connecting your on-premises environment to AWS:

1. **[[AWS Direct Connect]]** AWS Direct Connect provides a dedicated network connection between your on-premises network and AWS. 
    
2. **AWS [[VPN]] (Virtual Private Network):** AWS VPN allows you to establish secure and encrypted communication between your on-premises network and your Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ([[AWS VPC]]) using IPsec VPN tunnels. 
    
3. **[[AWS Transit Gateway]]:** AWS Transit Gateway simplifies the connectivity between multiple Amazon VPCs, your on-premises data centers, and remote office locations.
