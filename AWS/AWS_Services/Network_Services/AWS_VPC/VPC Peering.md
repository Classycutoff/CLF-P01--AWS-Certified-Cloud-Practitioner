# VPC Peering
----------

A _virtual private cloud_ ([[AWS VPC]]) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch AWS resources, such as Amazon [[Amazon EC2]] instances, into your VPC.

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses. Instances in either VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different [[Region]]s (also known as an inter-Region VPC peering connection).
