AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud [[storage service]] that connects [[on-premises]] environments with AWS cloud storage seamlessly. It allows you to securely store and retrieve data between your on-premises infrastructure and the AWS cloud, acting as a bridge between the two. It supports three types of storage interfaces: file, volume, and tape, enabling various use cases such as backup, disaster recovery, data archiving, and cloud-based application storage.
