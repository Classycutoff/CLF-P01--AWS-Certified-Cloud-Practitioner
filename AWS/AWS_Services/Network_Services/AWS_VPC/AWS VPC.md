With Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), you can launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.

The following diagram shows an example VPC. The VPC has one subnet in each of the [[Availability Zone]]s in the [[Region]], EC2 instances in each subnet, and an internet gateway to allow communication between the resources in your VPC and the internet.
