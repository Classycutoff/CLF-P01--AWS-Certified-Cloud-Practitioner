## AWS CloudTrail

Consider AWS CloudTrail as a detective that watches over your AWS account and environment. It provides information on:

- What action was taken
- Who performed it
- When the action was taken
- Where the action was taken

For instance, let’s say your S3 bucket was deleted by mistake. You can use AWS CloudTrail to see who deleted the bucket, when, and where (e.g. API Call or from the AWS [[AWS Management console]]).

Thus, the primary use case for AWS CloudTrail is to monitor the activity in your AWS environment. Additionally, CloudTrail is compliance support due to providing a history of activity in your AWS environment. So it’s easy to ensure your business is adhering to regulatory standards and internal policies.
