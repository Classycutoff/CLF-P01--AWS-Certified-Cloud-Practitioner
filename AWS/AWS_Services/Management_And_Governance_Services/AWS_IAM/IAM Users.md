# IAM Users

An AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) _user_ is an entity that you create in AWS. The IAM user represents the human user or workload who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.

An IAM user with administrator permissions is not the same thing as the AWS account root user. For more information about the root user, see [AWS account root user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_root-user.html).
