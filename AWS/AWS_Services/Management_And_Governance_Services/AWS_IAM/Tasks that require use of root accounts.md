In AWS, the root account is the original account created when you sign up for AWS services. It has full administrative privileges over the AWS environment and should be used sparingly and only for critical tasks. The use of root accounts is generally discouraged for routine operations due to security and accountability concerns. Instead, [[AWS IAM]] (Identity and Access Management) users and roles are recommended for most tasks to follow the principle of least privilege.

However, there are certain tasks or situations where the use of the root account may be necessary:

- **Initial Setup and Account Management:**
    - **Creating and Managing [[IAM Users]]:** The root account is required to create and manage IAM users and their permissions. After creating IAM users, it's recommended to use these users for day-to-day operations.
    - **Changing Account Settings:** Certain account settings, such as contact information, billing preferences, and email notifications, can only be managed by the root account.

- **Recovering Locked Out IAM Users:**
    - **Recovering Lost IAM User Access:** If all IAM users with administrator privileges are locked out or their permissions are revoked, the root account can be used to regain access and resolve the issue.

- **Billing and Subscription Management:**
    - **Accessing Billing Information:** The root account can access billing and subscription information, including setting up payment methods, viewing usage reports, and managing [[AWS Support]] subscriptions.

- **Managing Organizational Units (OU) in [[AWS Organizations]]:**
    - **Creating and Managing [[Organizational Units]]:** In an AWS Organizations setup, the root account has the necessary permissions to create and manage OUs that structure the member accounts.

- **Recovering from Certain Incidents:**
    - **Recovery from IAM User Errors:** If an IAM user misconfigures their permissions or denies their own access, the root account can be used to correct the situation.

-  **Account-Level Changes:**
    - **Closing AWS Accounts:** Only the root account can initiate the process to close an AWS account.
    - **Consolidated Billing:** Root accounts are involved in setting up consolidated billing for multiple accounts.

- **Accessing Certain Services and Resources:**
    - **Changing Certain Resource Attributes:** In some cases, resource attributes that are not directly managed through IAM policies might require root account access.
