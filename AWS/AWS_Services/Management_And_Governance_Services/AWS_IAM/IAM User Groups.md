An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users. For example, you could have a user group called _Admins_ and give that user group typical administrator permissions. Any user in that user group automatically has _Admins_ group permissions. If a new user joins your organization and needs administrator privileges you can assign the appropriate permissions by adding the user to the _Admins_ user group. If a person changes jobs in your organization, instead of editing that user's permissions you can remove them from the old user groups and add them to the appropriate new user groups.
