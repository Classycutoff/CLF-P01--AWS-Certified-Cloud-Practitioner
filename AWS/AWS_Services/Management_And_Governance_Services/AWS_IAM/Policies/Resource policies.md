**Resource-based policies** are attached to a resource. For example, you can attach resource-based policies to Amazon [[AWS S3]] buckets, Amazon [[AWS SQS]] queues, [[AWS VPC]] endpoints, and AWS [[AWS Key Management Service]] encryption keys. For a list of services that support resource-based policies, see [AWS services that work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html).
