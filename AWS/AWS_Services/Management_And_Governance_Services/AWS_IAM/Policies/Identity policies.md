**Identity-based policies** are attached to an IAM user, group, or role. These policies let you specify what that identity can do (its permissions). For example, you can attach the policy to the IAM user named John, stating that he is allowed to perform the Amazon [[Amazon EC2]] `RunInstances` action. The policy could further state that John is allowed to get items from an Amazon [[Amazon DynamoDB]] table named `MyCompany`. You can also allow John to manage his own IAM security credentials. Identity-based policies can be [managed or inline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_managed-vs-inline.html).
