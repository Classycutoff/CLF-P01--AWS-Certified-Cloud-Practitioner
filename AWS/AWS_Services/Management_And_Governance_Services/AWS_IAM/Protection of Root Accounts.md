AWS provides several mechanisms and best practices to help protect root accounts:

1. **[[MFA]] (Multi-Factor Authentication):** Enabling MFA for the root account adds an extra layer of security by requiring an additional authentication factor beyond the password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if the password is compromised. AWS supports various MFA methods, such as hardware tokens, virtual MFA devices, and SMS-based codes.
    
2. **[[IAM Users]] for Routine Operations:** Instead of using the root account for day-to-day operations, it's recommended to create an IAM user with the necessary permissions. This follows the [[Principle of least Privilege]] and limits the exposure of the root account's credentials.
    
3. **Access Control and Permissions:** Review and restrict permissions for the root account. Only assign permissions that are absolutely necessary. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies can help manage permissions effectively.
    
4. **Securing [[Access Key]]s:** If you must use access keys with the root account, ensure they are securely stored and rotated regularly. Avoid embedding access keys directly into scripts or applications.
    
5. **Limiting Direct Access:** Minimize direct access to the root account by using IAM users or roles for most tasks. Access the root account only when necessary, and apply the "just-in-time" access principle.
    
6. **Service Control Policies ([[SCPs]]):** Apply SCPs to restrict the actions that the root account can perform within [[AWS Organizations]]. This helps enforce security controls across accounts and [[Organizational Units]] (OUs).
    
7. **Using Strong Passwords:** Set a strong, unique password for the root account. Avoid using easily guessable information or passwords that are used elsewhere.
    
8. **Regularly Review Account Activity:** Monitor and review the root account's activity logs to identify any unusual or unauthorized actions. [[AWS CloudTrail ]]logs can provide insights into account activities.
    
9. **Logging and Monitoring:** Configure CloudTrail to log root account activity. Implement monitoring and alerts for any sign of suspicious behavior or unauthorized access.
    
10. **Limited Usage:** Reserve the root account for tasks that absolutely require its privileges, such as creating IAM users or managing billing information.
    
11. **Enable AWS Organizations:** Use AWS Organizations to centralize and manage multiple AWS accounts. This helps maintain a clear separation of duties and reduces the likelihood of root account misuse.
    
12. **Emergency Account Recovery:** AWS provides mechanisms for recovering a locked-out root account, but this process requires strict identity verification to prevent unauthorized recovery.
