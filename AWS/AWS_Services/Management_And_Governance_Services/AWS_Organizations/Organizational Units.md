Organizational Units (OUs) are a key feature of AWS Organizations that help you organize and manage accounts hierarchically. With OUs, you can group accounts together based on your organization's structure, business units, teams, or any other logical grouping that makes sense for your needs. OUs provide a way to manage policies, permissions, and control settings across multiple accounts within the same organization.
