# AWS Organizations

Centrally manage your environment as you scale your AWS resources
## How it works

AWS Organizations lets you create new AWS accounts at no additional charge. With accounts in an organization, you can easily allocate resources, group accounts, and apply governance policies to accounts or groups.
