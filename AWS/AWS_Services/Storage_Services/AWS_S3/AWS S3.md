Object [[Storage]] built to retrieve any amount of data from anywhere.

---------

You can store an essentially unlimited number of objects in S3 - either in a single bucket or across multiple in your account. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/BucketRestrictions.html "undefined")

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service offering industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can store and protect any amount of data for virtually any use case, such as data lakes, cloud-native applications, and mobile apps. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.

## Different  S3 Classes

The S3 storage classes include **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** for automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns, **S3 Standard** for frequently accessed data, **S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)** and **S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)** for less frequently accessed data, **S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** for archive data that needs immediate access, **S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval (formerly S3 Glacier)** for rarely accessed long-term data that does not require immediate access, and **Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive)** for long-term archive and digital preservation with retrieval in hours at the lowest cost storage in the cloud. If you have data residency requirements that can’t be met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the **S3 Outposts** storage class to store your S3 data on premises. Amazon S3 also offers capabilities to manage your data throughout its lifecycle. Once an S3 Lifecycle policy is set, your data will automatically transfer to a different storage class without any changes to your application.
