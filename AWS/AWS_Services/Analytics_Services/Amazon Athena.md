# Amazon Athena
-------------------
  
Amazon Athena is an interactive query service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to analyze data stored in Amazon [[S3]] using standard [[SQL]] queries. It allows you to quickly and easily query large amounts of data without the need for complex setup or managing infrastructure. Athena is particularly useful for ad-hoc querying and analysis of data in a data lake or other structured and semi-structured data sources.
