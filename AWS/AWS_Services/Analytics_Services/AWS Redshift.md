# AWS Redshift

Best price-performance for cloud for [[Data Warehouse]]s.

Redshift is a Data Warehouse, not to be confused with Redis, which is a version of ElastiCache, which could be used to help in this scenario.

## How it works

Amazon Redshift uses [[SQL ]]to analyze structured and semi-structured data across data warehouses, operational databases, and data lakes, using AWS-designed hardware and machine learning to deliver the best price performance at any scale.
