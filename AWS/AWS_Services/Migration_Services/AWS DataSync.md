## How it works

AWS DataSync is a secure, online service that automates and accelerates moving data between on premises and AWS Storage services. DataSync can copy data between Network File System (NFS) shares, Server Message Block (SMB) shares, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS), self-managed object storage, [[AWS Snowcone]], Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon [[AWS S3]]) buckets, Amazon Elastic File System ([[Amazon EFS]]) file systems, Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file systems, Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, Amazon FSz for OpenZFS file systems, and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.

AWS DataSync is also used to transfer data between AWS Storage services so you can replicate, archive, or share application data easily.

AWS DataSync supports moving data between other public clouds and AWS Storage services.
