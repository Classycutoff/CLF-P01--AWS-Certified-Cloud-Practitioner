# Elastic Container Service (ECS)

Run highly secure, reliable, and scalable [[Containers]].

--------
## How it works

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a fully managed container orchestration service that simplifies your deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. Simply describe your application and the resources required, and Amazon ECS will launch, monitor, and scale your application across flexible compute options with automatic integrations to other supporting AWS services that your application needs. Perform system operations such as creating custom scaling and capacity rules, and observe and query data from application logs and telemetry.
