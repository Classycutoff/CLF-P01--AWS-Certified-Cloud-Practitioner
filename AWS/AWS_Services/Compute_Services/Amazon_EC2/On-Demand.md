On-Demand Instances are, essentially, instances that you pay for as and when you need them. Think of these as “pay-as-you-go” instances, which you can be charged for either by the hour or by the second. You buy as much cloud computing capacity as you need, whenever you need it, with no long-term commitment. When you don’t need it anymore, you withdraw your workloads and cancel the instances, increasing or decreasing your cloud capacity as your computing needs change.
