Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down according to conditions you define. With EC2 Auto Scaling, you can ensure that the number of Amazon EC2 instances you’re using scales up seamlessly during demand spikes to maintain performance, and scales down automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs. EC2 Auto Scaling is particularly well suited for applications that experience hourly, daily, or weekly variability in usage. EC2 Auto Scaling is enabled by Amazon [[Amazon CloudWatch]] and available at no additional charge beyond Amazon CloudWatch fees.
