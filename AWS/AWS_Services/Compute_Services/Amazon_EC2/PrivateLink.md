Customers can privately access Amazon EC2 APIs from their Amazon Virtual Private Cloud ([[AWS VPC]]) or over AWS [[AWS Direct Connect]], without using public IPs, and without requiring the traffic to traverse across the Internet. AWS PrivateLink is a purpose-built technology designed for customers to access Amazon services in a high performance and highly available manner, while keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. In order to use Amazon EC2 with AWS PrivateLink, you will need to create an endpoint for EC2 in your VPC. Any traffic destined to this endpoint will get privately routed to the EC2 service.
