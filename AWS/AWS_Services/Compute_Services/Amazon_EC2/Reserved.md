Reserved Instances are configured almost exactly like On-Demand Instances. The only difference is that instead of requesting instances as and when you need them, you “reserve” instances for either [one year or three years](https://www.virtana.com/blog/demystifying-terminology-aws-instances/). 

That commitment pays off, as Reserved Instances offer pretty significant discounts compared to On-Demand instances.
