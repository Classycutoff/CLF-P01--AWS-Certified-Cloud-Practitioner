Cloud providers need to keep some space capacity available, in case there’s a huge surge in demand from customers — but for much of the time that spare capacity just sits unused.  

When you buy a Spot Instance, you’re essentially borrowing excess capacity from your cloud provider for a certain period of time. “Borrowing” is the operative word here. If demand goes up and your cloud provider needs that extra capacity, they’ll take it back — often with less than a minute’s notice before your workloads disappear.  

But that doesn’t mean you should avoid Spot Instances altogether — it just means you should use them strategically.
